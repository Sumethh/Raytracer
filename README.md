# Raytracer

This is a Raytracer that I wrote in my 2nd year of college. This project only contains code that I worked with and has no libraries. This project will not compile if you try to download and compile it. This is merely to show the code that I wrote.

The rendering template was provided to me by my school. The school provided the following files :
Surface.h
Surface.cpp
Template.h
Template.cpp

Everything else was edited or added by me.
